# Replication Excercise: Hetrogenous Treatment Effects

This project aims to replicate the main findings of a published Treatment Effects paper and extend it using causal forests to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (Wager & Athey, 2018). It is part of the PhD Econometrics II assessment at University College Dublin. The replication is due on April 10th, 2023, and the group is also required to present their findings on April 18th, 2023.

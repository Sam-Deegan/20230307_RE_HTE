3.Randomization

*Multi-level randomization at the Iddir level to assign the 144 Iddirs to six experimental arms
(number of Iddirs and observations in brackets)
1) Standard Index Insurance [IBI: 16 Iddirs, N=853]
2) Standard Index Insurance via Iddir promotions [IBI_Iddir: 48 Iddirs, N=3056]
3) IOU insurance [IOU: 16 Iddirs, N=685]
4) IOU insurance with Contract [IOU_C: 16 Iddirs, N=633]
5) IOU insurance via Iddir promotions [IOU_Iddir: 24 Iddirs, N=1887]
6) IOU insurance via Iddir promotions with Contract [IOU_Iddir_C: 24 Iddirs, N=1465]

Balancing tests
Dependent variables:
	(1) Household observables → Table 1
		Age (in years)
		Sex (male=1; female=0)
		Marital status (married=1; not-married=0)
		Education (years of schooling)
		Family size
		Total income in the last month (in Birr)
		Drought (household experienced a drought in the last three years=1; not experienced=0)
		Insurance (household had purchased index insurance during the past three years=1; not had purchased=0)
	(2) Farming variables → Table 2
		Maize, haricot, teff, sorghum, wheat, and barley (quantities of crops produced in the last cropping season)
		Land (total land under cultivation)
		Savings (having formal savings=1; not having=0)
Independent variables: Treatment group dummies (5 dummies)
Clustering: Iddirs
Wald tests (showing p-values of equality)


4. Results

4.1 Uptake

Uptake rates across IOU treatments, 95% CI clustered at Iddir level → Figure 1

Regression analysis → Table 3
Dependent variable: Uptake
Independent variable: Treatment group dummies
Clustering: Iddirs
Wald tests
(1) Parsimonious model → Column 1
(2) Additional controls → Column 2
	Controls:
		Age, Male, Married, Education level, Family size, Income last month, Drought dummy, Insured before dummy
		Maize production, Haricot production, Teff production, Sorghum production, Wheat production, Barley production
		Land size, Savings
	Fixed effects: Kebele
(3) Excluding Dalota Mati → Column 3
	Drop: Kebele==Dalota Mati (which all defaults belong to)
	Controls:
		Age, Male, Married, Education level, Family size, Income last month, Drought dummy, Insured before dummy
		Maize production, Haricot production, Teff production, Sorghum production, Wheat production, Barley production
		Land size, Savings
	Fixed effects: Kebele
	
4.2 Heterogeneity

Liquidity → Table 4
 (1) Median Income (IHS)
	Above: Households above median income → Colunm 1
	Below: Households below median income → Colunm 2
	Pooled: Adding income and the interaction term of income and treatment dummies → Column 3
(2) Savings
	Yes: Households with savings → Colunm 4
	No: Households without savings → Colunm 5
	Pooled: Adding savings and the interaction term of savings and treatment dummies → Column 6

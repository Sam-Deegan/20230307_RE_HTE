\section{Introduction}


\begin{itemize}

\item  Briefly explain the original study and its contribution to the literature

\item  Discuss the importance of replication in economics research and the goals of the replication paper

\end{itemize}

The study found that low uptake of insurance among smallholder farmers impairs their ability to manage risks associated with crop failure and reduce incentives for modernization. Conducted through a randomized control trial, the study observed a significant increase in insurance uptake among the sample population by deferring premium payments and leveraging community leaders to promote the product. The study's findings have implications for policymakers and stakeholders working to improve the financial resilience of smallholder farmers in developing countries.

Our replication and extension study aims to build on the original study's findings by replicating the results using the same data and methods. Additionally, we will estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a multi-arm causal forest approach to investigate whether the effects of insurance on smallholder farmers vary across different subgroups of the population. Through this analysis, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of how insurance can be used to support agricultural development in low-income countries.

In our study, we aim to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a multi-arm causal forest approach. This differs from the original study, which also estimated heterogeneous treatment effects but used a different method. Specifically, our approach allows us to estimate treatment effects for different subgroups of the population and account for potential interactions between different variables. Our results will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of insurance on smallholder farmers and inform policies aimed at improving their financial resilience.

<To do: Discuss the importance of the original study's findings: Discuss the original study's findings and their significance in the context of development economics. You can also discuss any limitations of the original study that your replication and extension study can address>

The paper is structured into six sections. The first section is the introduction, which provides an overview of the study and its objectives. The second section is the literature review, which discusses the existing research on the topic and identifies the research gaps that the study aims to address. The third section is the methodology, which describes the data sources, study design, and statistical techniques used to analyze the data. The fourth section is the results, which presents the findings of the study. The fifth section is the extension, which discusses the multi-arm causal forest approach used to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. The sixth and final section is the conclusion, which summarizes the study's key findings and their implications for policy and future research.

\section{Literature Review}

\begin{itemize}

\item Summarize the literature relevant to the original study and the replication

\item Discuss any issues with the original study that have been raised in the literature

\end{itemize}


\section{Methodology}

\begin{itemize}

\item Describe the data and methods used in the original study

\item Explain the steps taken to replicate the original study, including any changes made to the methods or data

\item Discuss any challenges faced in replicating the original study

\end{itemize}

C1. Replication Methodology: In this subsection, we describe the methodology used to replicate the original study. We provide a detailed explanation of the data and methods used in the original study, including any necessary assumptions or model specifications. We also explain the steps taken to ensure that our replication accurately reproduces the original study's results.

C2. Extension Methodology: In this subsection, we describe the methodology used for our extension analysis, which seeks to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a multi-arm causal forest approach. We provide an overview of the statistical methods employed, including any necessary assumptions or model specifications.

C3. Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: In this subsection, we provide a detailed explanation of our approach to estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using the multi-arm causal forest method. This includes information on the choice of tuning parameters, model diagnostics, and methods used for inference.

C4. Sensitivity Analyses: In this subsection, we describe the sensitivity analyses conducted to assess the robustness of our results to potential model misspecification and data limitations. We also discuss any limitations or caveats to our approach and provide suggestions for future research.

C5. Challenges and Limitations: In this subsection, we discuss any challenges faced in replicating the original study, including any discrepancies or issues with the data or code. We also discuss the limitations of our replication and extension analysis and provide suggestions for improving future research.











\section{Results}

\end{itemize}


\section{Extension}

\begin{itemize}

\item Describe any additional analyses or tests performed using the replicated data

\item Discuss the implications of the extended analysis for the original findings and the literature

\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}

\item Summarize the findings of the replication and extension studies

\item Discuss the implications of the replication for the original study and the literature

\item Recommend any changes to the original methods or data for future research

\end{itemize}


## Document Styling Guidelines
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not use an "Introduction" heading. Begin your introductory material
before the first section heading.

\item Avoid style markup (except sparingly for emphasis).

\item Avoid using explicit vertical or horizontal space.

\item Captions are short and go below figures but above tables.

\item The tablenotes or figurenotes environments may be used below tables
or figures, respectively, as demonstrated below.

\item If you have difficulties with the mathtime package, adjust the package
options appropriately for your platform. If you can't get it to work, just
remove the package or see our technical support document online (please
refer to the author instructions).

\item If you are using an appendix, it goes last, after the bibliography.
Use regular section headings to make the appendix headings.

\item If you are not using an appendix, you may delete the appendix command
and sample appendix section heading.

\item Either the natbib package or the harvard package may be used with bibtex.
To include one of these packages, uncomment the appropriate usepackage command
above. Note: you can't use both packages at once or compile-time errors will result.

\end{itemize}

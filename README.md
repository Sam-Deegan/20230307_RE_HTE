# Replication Excercise: Hetrogenous Treatment Effects

This project aims to replicate the main findings of a published Treatment Effects paper and extend it using causal forests to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (Wager & Athey, 2018). It is part of the PhD Econometrics II assessment at University College Dublin. The replication is due on April 10th, 2023, and the group is also required to present their findings on April 18th, 2023.

## Installation

To replicate the paper's main results, you need the original dataset and R. Dependencies vary depending on the analysis and libraries used. The project has three folders: Project Management, Build, and Analysis. The Build folder contains input data and cleaning, while the Analysis folder contains outputs and analysis.

## Usage

Forthcoming: Examples of how to use the project, including code snippets or screenshots if applicable. 

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are not open to outside contributors as it is a course assignment.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item  Briefly explain the original study and its contribution to the literature

\item  Discuss the importance of replication in economics research and the goals of the replication paper

\end{itemize}

The study found that low uptake of insurance among smallholder farmers
impairs their ability to manage risks associated with crop failure and
reduce incentives for modernization. Conducted through a randomized
control trial, the study observed a significant increase in insurance
uptake among the sample population by deferring premium payments and
leveraging community leaders to promote the product. The study's
findings have implications for policymakers and stakeholders working to
improve the financial resilience of smallholder farmers in developing
countries.

Our replication and extension study aims to build on the original
study's findings by replicating the results using the same data and
methods. Additionally, we will estimate heterogeneous treatment effects
using a multi-arm causal forest approach to investigate whether the
effects of insurance on smallholder farmers vary across different
subgroups of the population. Through this analysis, we hope to
contribute to a better understanding of how insurance can be used to
support agricultural development in low-income countries.

In our study, we aim to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a
multi-arm causal forest approach. This differs from the original study,
which also estimated heterogeneous treatment effects but used a
different method. Specifically, our approach allows us to estimate
treatment effects for different subgroups of the population and account
for potential interactions between different variables. Our results will
contribute to a better understanding of the impact of insurance on
smallholder farmers and inform policies aimed at improving their
financial resilience.

\textless To do: Discuss the importance of the original study's
findings: Discuss the original study's findings and their significance
in the context of development economics. You can also discuss any
limitations of the original study that your replication and extension
study can address\textgreater{}

The paper is structured into six sections. The first section is the
introduction, which provides an overview of the study and its
objectives. The second section is the literature review, which discusses
the existing research on the topic and identifies the research gaps that
the study aims to address. The third section is the methodology, which
describes the data sources, study design, and statistical techniques
used to analyze the data. The fourth section is the results, which
presents the findings of the study. The fifth section is the extension,
which discusses the multi-arm causal forest approach used to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects. The sixth and final section is the
conclusion, which summarizes the study's key findings and their
implications for policy and future research.

\section{Literature Review}

\hypertarget{document-styling-guidelines}{%
\subsection{Document Styling
Guidelines}\label{document-styling-guidelines}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Do not use an "Introduction" heading. Begin your introductory material
before the first section heading.

\item Avoid style markup (except sparingly for emphasis).

\item Avoid using explicit vertical or horizontal space.

\item Captions are short and go below figures but above tables.

\item The tablenotes or figurenotes environments may be used below tables
or figures, respectively, as demonstrated below.

\item If you have difficulties with the mathtime package, adjust the package
options appropriately for your platform. If you can't get it to work, just
remove the package or see our technical support document online (please
refer to the author instructions).

\item If you are using an appendix, it goes last, after the bibliography.
Use regular section headings to make the appendix headings.

\item If you are not using an appendix, you may delete the appendix command
and sample appendix section heading.

\item Either the natbib package or the harvard package may be used with bibtex.
To include one of these packages, uncomment the appropriate usepackage command
above. Note: you can't use both packages at once or compile-time errors will result.

\end{itemize}
